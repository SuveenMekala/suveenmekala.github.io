			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a proactive college student (3.5 GPA, Masters in Computer Science) currently attending Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. Currently working at Motorola Solutions in Chicago. Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at my university and working on Cyber Eye project funded by National Science Foundation under the guidance of Professor Ivan Mutis. During the course of my academic career, I also managed to accrue work experience during the summer. I had the privilege of working for General Electric Digital in San Ramon, CA as an Analytics Engineer in summer, where I learned valuable professional skills and tools such as Spark, Hadoop, AWS, Data Analytics, Application Development using Python. I also developed data cleansing modules for the PREDIX. In both my academic and professional life, I have been consistently praised as results-oriented by my professors and peers. Also, I love taking pictures of nature and architecture. </p>
